## About The Project



The Project was Created for Aygaz & Global AI HUB GenAI Bootcamp
This project was developed within the scope of Aygaz & Global AI HUB GenAI Bootcamp. The project aims to provide an interesting experience using artificial intelligence technologies and natural language processing models such as ChatGPT.

WingWonderland is a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript project that introduces different aircraft types and models. The project includes brief descriptions and images for each aircraft type. However, not all of these images are based on actual aircraft models; instead, it is created using artificial intelligence technologies.

Creating Photos
All photos are created with artificial intelligence technologies. Therefore, a 100% match to actual aircraft models cannot be guaranteed. Although the artificial intelligence models used in the creation of photographs were developed to obtain realistic images, they may be completely imaginary.

Using ChatGPT and Prompt ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
An interesting aspect of this project is that it teaches the use of prompts using natural language processing models such as ChatGPT. I trained ChatGPT with certain questions or statements and tried to get answers from it. The project allowed me to interact with artificial intelligence and gave me a different perspective on this technology.
